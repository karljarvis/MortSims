DEFINITIONS
population bottleneck: a population of some minimal size that is the result of some drastic demographic event19

inbreeding depression: a trend of decreased reproduction and/or survival in a population because of increased expression of recessive traits caused by inbreeding20

genetic drift: genetic sampling bias. Van Dyke20 defines it as “random fluctuations in gene frequencies that occur as a result of non-representative combinations of gametes created during breeding.” While it can affect populations of any size, genetic drift can disproportionately impact small populations. Why? Because as population size decreases, there is an increased chance that random matings between individuals (“sampling”) will not collectively be representative of the genetic variation found in the population. 20

heterozygosity: carrying different alleles for a particular genetic locus, as opposed to homozygous (having the same alleles) or hemizygous (having one allele). Average heterozygosity is a measure of genetic diversity at the population scale and indicates the average proportion of individuals that are heterozygous for a given trait. 20

gene flow: the transfer of genetic material. Defined by Slatkin as the collective term for “the movement of gametes, individuals, and even entire populations” which can hamper local adaptations or spread new genes and genetic combinations throughout a species’ range.21

apomictic: reproduction without either fertilization or meiosis; vegetative reproduction. 22

allopatric: refers to groups of organisms that are geographically separated such that gene flow cannot occur between them; reproductively isolated due to geography. 22

allelic richness: the number of alleles per locus23, often averaged over a population. It is expected to be more sensitive to founder effects than is heterozygosity.3

founder effect: occurs when a population that was founded by a small ancestral group experiences a high frequency of a particular allele because one or more of the founders was a carrier of that allele 24

hybrid: the offspring of two parents that differ in one or more heritable characteristics; offspring of two different varieties or of two different species.22

hybridization: the formation of offspring between unlike parents.22
